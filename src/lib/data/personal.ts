			'I\'m Alfred Emmanuel, a Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years building scalable, production-ready applications. Currently at InferenceCloud.ai, I specialize in AI systems architecture, full-stack development, and technical leadership. I\'ve shipped 50+ production systems and help companies implement AI solutions that deliver real business value—not just proof-of-concepts that break in production.',
		long: 'My name is Alfred Emmanuel. I\'m a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience shipping production systems across multiple continents. Currently working as a Full Stack Engineer at InferenceCloud.ai, I specialize in AI implementation, system architecture, and full-stack development.\n\nI take a practical, results-driven approach to engineering. Whether it\'s building AI-powered financial applications, architecting real-time security systems processing 50+ camera streams, or implementing semantic search across millions of documents—I focus on solutions that work at scale.\n\nMy technical foundation spans Python, TypeScript, React, and modern cloud infrastructure (AWS, Docker, K8s). I\'m equally comfortable building elegant frontends with Next.js and Tailwind as I am optimizing backend systems with FastAPI and PostgreSQL. I have hands-on experience with LLMs, computer vision, vector databases, and the full spectrum of AI/ML tools.\n\nI\'m also building GrindProof, my own SaaS where I test architecture patterns and AI implementations before deploying them to client production environments. This "architecture lab" approach means you benefit from battle-tested solutions, not experimental code.\n\nBased in Abuja, Nigeria, I work with global clients and bring a unique perspective on building systems that work in diverse, real-world conditions. I\'m available for consulting engagements from $500 AI audits to fractional CTO arrangements. If your AI project is stuck, your costs are spiraling, or you need honest technical guidance—let\'s talk.'
